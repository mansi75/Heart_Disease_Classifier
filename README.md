# Heart_Disease_Classifier

Heart disease is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This is true in all areas of the world except few. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s.

## About the Dataset

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 which means presence of no hear disease and 1 means presence of disease. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence i.e value 1 from absence (value 0).

The data includes 303 patient level features including if they have heart disease at the end or not. Features are like;

  * 0: Female
